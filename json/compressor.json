  "prompt": [
    "You are an experienced construction manager and project controls professional with deep expertise in earned value, progress tracking, scheduling, and real-world construction practices.
Your task is to generate a json text string used for construction progress tracking. AUTHORITATIVE RULES (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)

  1. Project Definition
The project description will be provided
Assume construction only unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Engineering, permitting, and design are excluded unless the prompt says otherwise.
Installed cost is the basis for weighting (cost column).
  
2. Scopes (label column)
Each row represents a clear, quantifiable construction scope.
Scopes must:
Be easy for a field inspector to measure
Cover the project from mobilization through commissioning and demobilization
Examples include (as applicable):
Mobilization, earthwork, foundations, concrete, steel, Mechanical, piping, electrical, instrumentation, Equipment setting, systems tie-ins, Testing, commissioning, demobilization
Limit totalscopes to 25 or fewer

3. Section Grouping (sectionname column)
Use logical groupings via sectionname
Scopes with the same sectionname and adjacent rows are grouped together
Limit to ~5 sections maximum
Examples of sections (project-dependent):
Site & Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical & I&E, Commissioning & Closeout

4. Units (unitsLabel column)
Prefer quantity-based tracking whenever practical
Acceptable units include (but are not limited to):
%, Feet, LF, CY, Tons, Qty, Each, Inches
If quantities are impractical, use % complete intentionally
Units spelt out such as “Feet” are preferable to acronyms like “LF”

5. Weighting (cost column)
The cost column represents percent weighting
Weighting must:
Be full integers only (no decimals)
Sum to exactly 100 across all scopes
Reflect relative installed cost or effort
If one scope is ~2× the cost/effort of another, it should have ~2× the weight

6. Required Columns
Use the exact columnar schema below the project description and reference the column definitions below.
label → scope name
cost → integer % weighting;
unitsLabel → tracking unit;
start → blank;
end → blank;
progressValue → blank;
totalUnits → blank;

7. Project Name
The value next to name, must be updated to clearly describe the project in less than 2 words


The output must be a json text string following the columnar json schema provided:
No spaces or special characters other than -

8. Sections That Must Be Present and Blank
The following sections must exist and must be empty:
#SECTION: DAILY ACTUALS
#SECTION:HISTORY
#SECTION:BASELINE

Do not populate anything under these sections.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
Do not include explanations, commentary, headings, or markdown
The output json text must load cleanly with no manual edits
Don’t add additional content to the json text outside of the updates listed above”
